      <h2>The Mission</h2>
      <p>Launched on December 25, 2021, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) represents a monumental leap in our quest to understand the Universe and its origins. 
        As the premier observatory of the next decade, JWST will examine every phase of cosmic history. From the luminous glow emitted just after 
        the Big Bang 13.5 billion years ago to the formation of galaxies, stars, and planets.</p> 
        
      <p>Unlike its predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope, JWST orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.5 million kilometers (1 million miles) away from Earth and is stationed 
        at Earth's second <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point">Lagrange point (L2)</a>. As JWST continues its mission, it promises to revolutionize our knowledge of the Universe, unveiling its 
        secrets and inspiring generations of astronomers and scientists.</p>

        <dt><h3>Mission Goals:</h3></dt>
        <dt>Study the Early Universe</dt>
        <dd>JWSTs powerful infrared cameras can look back over 13.5 billion years to see the first generation of stars and galaxies forming just after the beginning of the universe.</dd>
        
        <dt>Document Galaxy Evolution</dt>
        <dd>Webb is helping astronomers compare the earliest galactic formations to the vast variety of spiral and elliptical galaxies we see today, helping us understand the life history of galactic evolution.</dd>
        
        <dt>Monitor the Lifecycle of Stars</dt>
        <dd>Webb's sensitive observation equipment is capable of piercing the enormous clouds of dust that surround new born stars through infrared imaging.  These shrouds are otherwise opaque in the visible light spectrum and offers astronomers a unique insight into star formation and evolution.</dd>

        <dt>Collect Atmospheric Data of Planets/Exoplanets</dt>
        <dd>JWST is also capable of analyzing the light reflected by the atmospheres of distant worlds, both within our own solar system and beyond. Learning about the complex chemistries of alien atmospheres provides insight into the formation of planets and provides a mechanism to potentially detect the biological signatures of life outside the solar system.</dd>
